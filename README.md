# apprenticeship-2022_01_13-task-fraction_calculator-revision_1

After making a regular calculator 2 days prior, we were tasked with making a fraction calculator, which became a bit more complex, primarily due to the extra features. Partly because of my lack of familiarity with using Git locally, but primarily because our teacher did not immediately give away what exactly we were going to do (I *hate*  it when he does that), I was still adhering to my old versioning scheme and didn't really save separate builds as I would've normally liked, and instead treated the different builds as different solutions to different problems. However, for a variety of reasons - including the versioning - I decided to rewrite the entire thing, but I decided to upload that in a separate repo because of the large differences, including the file structure (hence the "revision_1").
